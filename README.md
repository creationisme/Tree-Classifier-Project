# Tree-Classifier-Project

In this project, we compare a simple Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model on the same dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation.
We implement 5-fold cross validation and then tune our parameters using Grid Search and Randomized Search.
